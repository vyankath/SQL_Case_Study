## **Introduction**

Danny's Diner is a small restaurant specializing in Japanese cuisine, including sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny wants to use data from the restaurant's operations to better understand his customers' behavior, spending patterns, and preferences. This information will help him improve customer experience and make informed decisions about the customer loyalty program.

This case study uses three key datasets provided by Danny: sales, menu, and members. The goal is to answer specific questions that can help Danny run his business more effectively.

Datasets
Danny has provided the following datasets:

* sales: Transaction records of customers, including purchase dates and items.
* menu: Details about the items available on the menu, including prices.
* members: Information about customers who joined the loyalty program, including their join dates.
Case Study Questions
Each of the following questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

## **Conclusions**
After conducting the analysis, several noteworthy findings have been uncovered that could be valuable for Danny:

* Customer B holds the record for the most visits, with six visits in January 2021.
